    "Below, we test consistency in responses using [SelfCheckGPT](https://github.com/potsawee/selfcheckgpt). The paper offers 5 approaches for checking consistency:\n",
    "1. BERTScore: finds the average BERTScore of ths i-th sentence with the most similar sentence from each sample. If information in a sentnece appears in many samples, one can assume that the information is factual. \n",
    "2. Question Answering: generates multiple-choice questions over the main passage, which a separate question answering system can attempt to answer while conditioned on  the other sampled respones. If questions on consistent information are queried, the answering system should predict similar answers.\n",
    "3. N-gram: idea is to use sampled responses to create a new langauge model that approximates the generating LLM. when N is large, the new model will converse to LLM resposnes. Practically, this is done by training a n-gram model using the samples and original passage. The final score is the average log-probability of each token in the original passage, as computed by the n-gram model.\n",
    "4. Natural Language Inference (NLI): determins whether a hypothesis follows a premise, classified as entailment, neutral, or contradition. Score is defined as the average probability of contradition given the reference sentence across all sampled passages. The final score is the probability of contradiction for each sentence\n",
    "5. LLM Prompting: uses an LLM to check if the i-th sentence in the passaage us supported by the sample for each sample. The final score is an average of how many sampeld sentences support the i-th sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for any that split a passage into separate sentences, you'll get an array of scores for each sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM prompting method was shown to be most effective, but NLI method is not significantly worse. Below, we use the NLI method since it's faster to compute and offers close enough accuracy. "
