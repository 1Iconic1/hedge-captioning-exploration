       "  How much does a product being uncommon or unique affect the quality of AI generated captions? How well does the AI tool help you assess whether a product you are taking a photo of is uncommon or unique? Again, think about the AI tool you use most to caption products. When the tool says a photo is not good enough to caption or returns a similar error, how confident are you in knowing why the photo is not good enough? Microsoft Seeing AI's Product feature provides beeping sounds to help you get the product in clear view of the camera. If you've used this feature, what worked well and what didn't? Be My AI gives you feedback if the photo you took is not of sufficient quality. If you've used this feature, what worked well and what didn't? TapTapSee has an autofocus notification to let the user know when an object is in focus. If you've used this feature, what worked well and what didn't?  \\\n",

       "  On average, how much time does it take you to get the information you want using the AI tool you use most often? Think about how long it takes in total to take a good photo, submit the photo to the AI tool, receive a response from the tool, read the response, and ask follow up questions if details are missing. Which part of the process takes the longest to complete? Which part of the process is the most difficult for you? On average, how many photos do you need to take to get the AI tool to provide the information you want regarding a product? If the tool you use most has a streaming video feature, please answer this question regarding the photo captioning feature.  One reason we are conducting this survey is because taking high quality photos that result in good captions from AI tools is hard for many people. If you have additional thoughts on the difficulties of taking good photos or ways AI tools could make taking good photos easier for you, please add them below.  \\\n",

       "  When identifying or understanding products, how often do you verify the output of an AI tool with a human visual interpreter or other sighted person? Now, think of your experience using AI tools more broadly. How much does whether you are using an accessibility specific tool (e.g., Seeing AI, Be My AI, TapTapSee) versus a general purpose AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini) affect the quality of AI generated captions for products? If you have noticed a difference in the quality of captions generated by accessibility specific AI tools versus general purpose AI tools, please describe the differences you have noticed. Based on your experience, how often are AI generated captions for products not accurate (e.g., captions a box of cereal as pasta)? Based on your experience, how often are AI generated captions for products accurate but missing critical information (e.g., captions it as a can of beans but does not say what type of beans)?  \\\n",

       "  Based on your experience, how often are AI generated captions only partially correct (e.g., a can of soup is captioned as a can of green beans)? Based on your experience, how often do AI generated captions include extra, incorrect details (e.g., a bag of green peas is captioned as a bag of green peas and corn)? Based on your experience, how often are AI generated captions completely made up (e.g., you accidentally cover the camera with your finger but AI says it's a picture of the moon)? Thinking about the AI tool you use most, what kinds of information and details do you feel are often missing from AI generated captions of products? Have you developed any strategies or tricks that help you get high quality AI generated captions of products? If so, please explain what you do.
